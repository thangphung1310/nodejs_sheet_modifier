Make sure you already installed Node.js in your computer. Run `node -v` in your terminal to check if node is installed.

1. Clone or download the repo
2. In the repo, run `npm install` to install the required packages
3. Run `node main.js` to run the script
4. The script should generate a processed CSV file called "processed_demo_report_20200820.csv" from the original file "Demo_report_20200820.xlsx"

You can change the input file "Demo_report_20200820.xlsx" to see different results.
